# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹

In this book, you will find guides, examples, and recipes on how to use the
Avail SDK.

The guides are divided into two parts:

- An overview of how to use the most common interfaces provided by the SDK
- A more detailed explanation of how they work

Examples are short code snippets that demonstrate specific functionality in
isolation, such as batching transactions, while recipes provide complete,
contextual examples.

The SDK is rich in functionality and is constantly being improved. This means
that the book will not cover everything, so feel free to explore on your own ðŸ™‚
